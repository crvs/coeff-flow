# Coefficient Flow algorithm

## Introduction
This repository imelements the `Coefficient_Flow` algorithm presented in [1].

## Compiling

In order to compile this repository you will need the following packages:

- `cmake (v >= 2.8)`
- `clang (v == 3.8)`
- `Eigen (v == 3.3.2)`
- `Boost (v >= 1.54.0)`
- `CGAL  (v >= 4.9.1)`
- `Gudhi (v >= 1.3.1)`
- `libyaml`

**Note:** In case you are using a different version of `clang`, everything should still compile without problems, but you will need to change the appropriate lines in `CMakeLists.txt`.
